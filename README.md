# Noark

Noark is simple application that embeds a WebView into a native OS X application. In `Appdelegate.m` there is a line `[webView setMainFrameURL:@"http://forsmo.me"];` that tells the WebView which url to load.

This more a boostrap project for a native OS X application with embedded WebView.

Will add Webkit Notification support later, right now Noark have a notification file that can be used to create Notification for OS X 10.8 Notification Center.
